# Crawlora VLR.gg API client for PHP (`crawlora/vlr`)

This PHP package calls Crawlora's hosted VLR.gg API at `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`. It exposes 23 endpoints covering Valorant matches, events, results, rankings, statistics, news, and forum data. It does not call or scrape VLR.gg directly. Requests require a Crawlora API key and use your Crawlora account's service plan.

## Install

```sh
composer require crawlora/vlr
```

Create an account at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net/signup?utm_source=packagist&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=vlr-php-signup), open the [Crawlora console](https://crawlora.net/app?utm_source=packagist&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=vlr-php-console) to get an API key, then set `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` in your environment.

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Crawlora\Vlr\Client(apiKey: getenv('CRAWLORA_API_KEY'));
$result = $client->request("vlr-search", ['q' => 'sample']);
print_r($result);
$client->close();
```

The client uses PHP cURL and JSON. Constructor options are `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, and `timeout`. Call the operation-specific method for direct access to each supported operation, or `request($operationId, $params, $responseType)` to dispatch by operation ID. Set `$responseType` to `text` for raw text output such as transcript formats. The package includes 23 API operations.
